Developing my knowledge and skills based on what I have learnt during my time at Kingston University including: 
1) Programming in Java: Problem-Solving and Writing Algorithms, Data Structures, OOP, Singleton Pattern, Unit Testing, Desktop Automated GUI Testing
2) Web Development in PHP and JavaScript: HTTP Requests, Sessions, Forms, DOM, AJAX, HTML, CSS, BootStrap, MVC
3) Databases Theory: Normalisation, Distributed Databases, Transactions and Concurrency Control, Query Processing/Optimisation and physical database design)
4) Databases (Practical): Relational DB Design & ER Diagrams, SQL programming
5) Business Analysis, Project Management, QA, version control using GitHub and Tortoise Git, IP Addressing, Networks, Hardware and OS

....from my first development role, I:
1) Became familiar with .NET (Web Forms) and debugging using Visual Studio (this project will not being using web forms)
2) Learnt advanced topics in Excel and VBA (this project will not be focusing on Excel/VBA; see https://github.com/SonyaNadesan/ReusablePerformanceOptimisedVBAFunctions for this)

...after a year and a half as Graduate Developer, I moved to Marie Curie where I learnt a lot including:
1) A deeper understanding of the .NET Framework, coding standards and ASP.NET MVC (C#); in this project, I will be exploring .NET Core
2) ORMs - Entity Framework 6 (code first and DB first) as well as LINQ; in this project, I will be exploring EF Core using a code-first approach
3) Security : ASP.NET Identity, authenitcation cookies,XSRF, salts; in this project, I will be exploring ASP.NET Identity Core
4) Generics, Various Design Patterns and SOLID e.g.Repository, Service, Builder, Factory, Unit of Work (which I did not implement properly in this project!) etc.
5) Async, Await and Tasks, Multithreaded programming, lcoks, smeaphores, race conditions
6) JavaScript: Fetch API, Closures, Minification
7) CMS Development using EpiServer (this project will not be using EpiServer nor other CMS)
